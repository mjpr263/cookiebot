2. Integration
==============

To use cookiebot you need a cookiebot-account & domaingroup-id / CBID.
If you don't have a cookiebot-account or an domaingroup-id you can generate one on https://www.cookiebot.com

1. Include static template
2. Add your cookiebot domaingroup-id / CBID (Format: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) in the constants-editor or use ``plugin.tx_cookiebot_cookiebot.settings.apikey`` in the constants.
3. After that your cookie consent banner will show up as configured in your cookiebot.com-settings.
4. Add the plugin ``Cookiebot`` as an content-element on the specific page and at the exact position where you would like the cookie declaration to appear.
5. (optional) Select cookie blockingmode (automatic cookie blocking or manual cookie blocking) in the constants-editor or use ``plugin.tx_cookiebot_cookiebot.settings.blockingmode`` in the constants. Default-Setting: Automatic cookie blocking. Please note the instructions for manual cookie blocking on https://www.cookiebot.com/en/manual-implementation/

3. TYPO3-Version support
========================

Cookiebot extension supports TYPO3 version 9 & 10.

4. Changelog
============
Version 1.1.0
-------------
- Now you can change between automatic or manual cookie blocking mode.

Version 1.0.2
-------------
- Fixes a wording error in the constants-editor where the "cookiebot API key" was requested. The cookiebot domaingroup-id (CBID) is required here.
- Fixes a bug where the cookiebot-script was not integrated as the very first JavaScript. Integration now takes place directly after the opening "head" tag. This ensures that no cookies escape the automatic cookie blocking.
- Add cache-clearing on installation

-------------
- Small edit in licence and description. No code-change!

Version 1.0.0
-------------
- Initial release to TER
